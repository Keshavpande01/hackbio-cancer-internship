- **_TITLE  :- TCGA (THE CANCER GENOMICS ATLAS )_**

 

**INTRODUCTION**

In the beginning new era the development of the cancer genomics atlas was landmark to study the genomic study of different types of cancer study it was developed my joint work of National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in 2006.

The idea behind the creating the platform was to assist researcher in exploratory analysis by identifying changes in cancer cell that may important role in cancer development.  Various data like mutation data copy number variation quantification post transcriptional modification structural variation protein expression data can be downloaded from the portal. By analyzing tumor and matched normal tissue samples across over 33 different cancer types, TCGA has significantly advanced our understanding of cancer biology, enabling the development of more personalized treatment strategies This manuscript examines the objectives, methodologies, key findings, and the profound impact of TCGA on cancer research and clinical practice

**Method**

The goal of the TCGA is to study various types of tumors by integrating multiple platforms learning their molecular characteristics. This included both tumor and adjacent normal samples collected from the same individual. In addition to genetic and exome sequencing, it is possible to apply other sequencing techniques such as sequencing of RNA and profiling of DNA methylation. Importantly, in addition to the WTSI, TCGA also carried out a whole protein expression and modification analysis using proteomics. Actually, the patients’ clinical data are available for most cases – their characteristics, treatment regimens, and clinical results.

**Results**

This resulted in the formation, in the framework of the TCGA initiative, of an extensive, multi-dimensional array of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data on over twenty thousand primary cancer specimens and normal tissues. Of numerous other fruitful results derived from this project, one major result, indeed, included identifying new subtypes of several types of common cancers, namely, breast, lung and colon cancers. These subtypes were marked by molecular profiles that may significantly influence targeting therapy development. Moreover, TCGA data as presented above has also contributed significant aspects in terms of the mutations and pathways relevant for cancer development such as the discovery of the IDH1 mutation in gliomas and hence a new target in drug development.

**Conclusion**

It is the major project in cancer genetics. At the same time, it has also been very beneficial to the researchers and clinicians. The project ΤCGΑ provides a corresponding approach to cancer genomics, by mapping out the history of genetic changes and opening a new path to creating medical care aimed at specific pathological processes. Online TCGAs for colon does quite a few things well. First, they exemplify a large project. Secondly, their goals are what TCGA aims to achieve, but in a more systematic and productive fashion. A future based on the findings from the TCGA will in all probability deepen our comprehension of cancer and help us in assisting our patients.
